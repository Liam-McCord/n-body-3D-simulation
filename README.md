# n-body-3D-simulation (and hopefully AI prediction)
I'm making a 3D n-body orbital simulator to create an AI dataset later on.

Hey, this is a summer project of mine that I wanted to try before I went to University (though I may work on it there if I get any time).
I've always wanted to build something like this from scratch, and so I decided I would learn Linear Algebra early and give it a try. Similar projects have been
done before but I thought I'd try it myself, while deriving the equations as I go to learn some stuff along the way. It's nothing special but I think it will be good
practice :)

If you find this page and have any questions just let me know!
